I could see that the photographer always got in their way, and I can’t imagine how come their videos are eventually so good, because I was sure all I’m gonna see is this guy and his camera. They were so professional about it, it really speaks volumes.

                        <p class="answer__text">
                           Wedding photographers and videographers are performing the same job, and to do it well they need the same elements- flattering angles, good lighting, right timing.When they work as a team, their working process resembles a dance where each one knows how to move, so both of them get what they need. They focus on this flow instead of competing with each other for the best material, as it often happens when two strangers are hired, each to do his own business.
                        </p>
                        <p class="answer__question">MAY I CUSTOMISE MY PHOTO AND VIDEO POST PRODUCTION?</p>
                        <p class="answer__text">
                           Most of our clients give us the full creative power over their wedding photos and videos and trust that we will use our skills and knowledge to polish it to its maximum potential. However, sometimes clients request a specific style of colouring or a particular soundtrack for their videos, and that is fine with us.
                        </p>
                        <p class="answer__question">WILL MY PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEOS LOOK THE SAME?</p>
                        <p class="answer__text">
                           Yes, we colour grade our materials identically in order to maintain a uniform style. Most of our clients prefer natural looking colour correction, with deep hues and timeless feel to it, so that is what we strive for unless requested differently.

                        <p class="answer__question">HOW MANY PHOTOS CAN I EXPECT?</p>
                        <p class="answer__text">
                           We submit around 70-100 HQ edited photos per one hour of coverage. If it's a 10 hours coverage, you get around 1000 photos, but it also depends on how busy your wedding day is. If you have many ceremonies, rituals and performances, you may expect this amount to double.
                        </p>
                        <p class="answer__question">WHAT ARE TURNAROUND TIMES?</p>
                        <p class="answer__text">
                           For photography, the turnaround is one month. We also send you around ten edited pictures within two days after the wedding so you can share them with your relatives right away.
                           For the video, the deadline is three months from the moment the client has chosen a soundtrack. It depends on the season, but usually, we submit videos after roughly a month and a half.
                        </p>
                        <p class="answer__question">WHAT IS SO SPECIAL ABOUT YOUR SILENT COVERAGE?</p>
                        <p class="answer__text">
                           We use mirrorless cameras that don't have a clicking mechanism, so our photo cameras are silent. You won't hear any distracting noises during the ceremony or at any other time, as well asаааа on your video.
                           Also, it means that our cameras can take more frames per second, ensuring that we capture every moment.
